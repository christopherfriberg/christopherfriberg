Just created this using [Jekyll] [jekyll].

Need to make some modifications and deploy - probably on Heroku.

Should be a decent testbed for HTML and CSS, as well as maintaining a site. Need to register a domain and get it hooked up.

Not sure if I will actually use the blog portion too much, but maybe use it to document any changes made to the site.
