ChristopherFriberg.com 1.0. Probably should be a 0.x, but as it's up and deployed, I'll start with 1.0.

This site is build using [Jekyll][jekyll], a Ruby static site generator. I will mostly be using this to showcase my resume and practice maintaining/updating a website.

Some changes from default Jekyll implementation:

*	Nav bar styling has been adjusted and the Resume section added.
*	Fonts for the whole site have been changed to Avenir.
*	Previews have been added for blog posts.
*	LinkedIn social media added to the footer. SVG taken from [Codepen][codepen]
*	Minor CSS adjustments throughout.
