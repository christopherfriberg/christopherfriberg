Not too many changes:

* Add image to the main page
* Add image to the about page
* Remove default Jekyll post

This wasn't mentioned in the previous post, but at the moment I am hosting using [Github Pages] [github-pages]. The next step for me is to register a .com domain and get the URL switched over.
