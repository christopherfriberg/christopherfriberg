In 2010 I graduated from Gordon College with a BA in Economics and minor in Computer Science. I enjoy problem-solving and figuring out how things work.

From 2014 to 2015 I worked at Teikametrics in a consulting-based role, assisting clients on a daily basis with proper implementation of the Teikametrics tools.

From 2011 to 2014 I worked as an in-house analyst for a multimillion-dollar Amazon retailer, managing a high volume inventory catalog.
